/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and role-based access control.
 * All data is stored in top-level collections: /users, /tasks, /clients, /attendance, /courses.
 * Each document is secured based on a combination of user identity (request.auth.uid) and, in some cases,
 * denormalized ownership data within the document itself (e.g., createdBy, assignedTo).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed for privacy.
 * - The ruleset prioritizes secure authorization, but data shape validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping.
 * - Where applicable, ownership is validated on both create and update operations to prevent privilege escalation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Tasks: Require 'createdBy' field to match request.auth.uid on creation. Enforce ownership on updates/deletes.
 * - Files: Associate files with tasks via 'taskId'. Files are secured through the parent task.
