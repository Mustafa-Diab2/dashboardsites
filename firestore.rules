/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-centric security model, with ownership-based access control for user-specific data and public read access for certain collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task information. Accessible to any authenticated user.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}/files/{fileId}: Stores files associated with a task. Accessible to any authenticated user.
 * - /attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores user attendance records. Accessible to any authenticated user.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores courses assigned to users. Accessible to any authenticated user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - Data validation is limited to ownership checks and relational integrity, with flexible data shapes for prototyping.
 * - Public read access is granted to some collections but write access is restricted to validated owners.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Course' entity includes a 'userId' field, which is used to enforce ownership.  Rules will ensure that only the user specified by 'userId' can modify that Course.  The same applies to Tasks, Files, and Attendance.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - There are no public/private variations that require structural segregation.
