/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Team Task Dashboard application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, where users can have 'admin', 'backend', or 'frontend' roles.
 * User data is protected with owner-only access, while tasks and files have more nuanced permissions based on roles and ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with 'role' being a critical field for authorization.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task details, including assignee, status, team, and timestamps.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}/files/{fileId}: Stores file metadata related to a specific task.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and update their own user documents, unless they are admins.
 * - Task creation is restricted to admins.
 * - Task updates are allowed for admins or the assigned user (assigneeId) for status and assigneeId fields only.
 * - File creation is allowed for admins or the user who uploaded the file (uploadedBy).
 * - Listing tasks is allowed for all signed-in users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To optimize security rules and avoid costly `get()` calls, the user's `role` is ideally denormalized directly into the `/tasks/{taskId}` documents upon creation or update.
 * This allows rules to efficiently check a user's role without needing to read their user document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The app uses a hierarchical structure with subcollections (e.g., `/tasks/{taskId}/files/{fileId}`) to organize data and enforce access control.
