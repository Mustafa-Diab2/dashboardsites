/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user data and task assignments, with admin overrides for certain operations. It leverages denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls and prioritizes secure access to file metadata.
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Each user can only read/write their own profile.
 *   - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task details. Tasks can be assigned to users, and admins can manage all tasks. The `userRole` is denormalized from the user document to enable efficient authorization.
 *   - /tasks/{taskId}/files/{fileId}: Stores file metadata. Only admins or the uploader can manage files.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Users can only read/write their own profile data. Listing all users is disallowed.
 *   - Tasks are generally readable, but modification requires either admin privileges or ownership (createdBy).
 *   - File access is restricted to admins and the user who uploaded the file.
 *   - User roles are denormalized into tasks to avoid costly `get()` calls in security rules. This approach assumes that Firebase Functions maintain data consistency between user roles and tasks.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - User roles are denormalized into task documents to avoid costly `get()` calls. When a task is created, the user's role is copied into the `userRole` field of the task document.
 * @structuralSegregation
 *   - There is no structural segregation.
