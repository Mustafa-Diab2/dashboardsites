/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and role-based access control.
 * Users have full control over their own data, while administrative roles can manage broader aspects of the application.
 * Authorization independence is achieved through data denormalization where possible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.  Access is restricted to the owner and potentially admins (if roles were defined).
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task information. Ownership is determined by the `createdBy` field.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}/files/{fileId}: Stores file metadata associated with tasks. Access is restricted to the uploader or task owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent enumeration.
 * - Owner-only access is enforced by default unless explicitly overridden.
 * - Data consistency between document IDs and internal ownership fields is enforced on creation and updates.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules assume the `Task` document contains a denormalized `createdBy` field which matches the authenticated user's UID. This is used to authorize write operations.
